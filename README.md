## üé≥ For Bowlers: What is BowlBetter!?

BowlBetter! is a simple, private, and easy-to-use web app that helps you improve your bowling approach, one step at a time. Just upload photos of each step in your approach, and BowlBetter! will give you clear, supportive feedback and tips‚Äîjust like a real coach would.

**How to get the best images:**

- **Tip:** The easiest way to capture great images of your approach is to record a video of yourself bowling (slo-motion at 240fps is best if your phone supports it).
- **Then:** Play back the video, pause at each key step of your approach, and take a screenshot. This gives you clear, frame-by-frame images to upload.

**How it works:**

1. **Upload your step images:** Take a photo or screenshot of each step in your approach (for example, 4-step or 5-step approach) and upload them all at once, or one by one.
2. **Get friendly analysis:** The app will analyze each step, pointing out what you‚Äôre doing well and where you can improve, using easy-to-understand language and positive encouragement.
3. **See overall tips:** After all steps are analyzed, you‚Äôll get a summary with actionable advice to help you bowl better next time!

**Your privacy:**

- Your images are only used for analysis and are not stored or shared.
- You control your data‚Äîjust refresh the page to clear everything.

## üßë‚Äçüíª For Technical Users & Developers

BowlBetter! is powered by the [Groq API](https://groq.com), leveraging the blazing-fast Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct vision model for step-by-step image analysis and chat-based recommendations.

### Features

- **Bulk image upload:** Drag and drop or select multiple images to auto-assign them to steps.
- **Step-by-step feedback:** Each image is analyzed individually, with results shown per step.
- **Comprehensive summary:** All step analyses are synthesized into a final, actionable recommendation.
- **API key privacy:** API key is hidden by default, with a toggle to show/hide.
- **Mobile-friendly:** Swipe between steps on touch devices. The layout and text wrap for easy reading on phones.

### How It Works (Technical)

- **Frontend:** Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No backend required.
- **Image Analysis:** Each step image is sent as a base64-encoded data URL to the Groq API `/openai/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, using the `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` model.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Prompts are crafted to elicit friendly, coach-like, and beginner-friendly feedback, but can be adapted for more technical output if desired.
- **Final Recommendation:** After all steps are analyzed, a comprehensive prompt is sent to the Groq API to generate a holistic summary and improvement plan.

### Example API Call

```js
const payload = {
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: [
        { type: "text", text: "Analyze this bowling approach step..." },
        { type: "image_url", image_url: { url: "data:image/jpeg;base64,..." } }
      ]
    }
  ],
  model: "meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct",
  max_tokens: 1000
};
fetch('https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions', { ... });
```

### Customization

- **Model:** You can swap the model or adjust prompts for more technical or advanced analysis.
- **UI:** All logic is in a single HTML file for easy modification.
